## Skills

#### Application Design and Project Management

I have experience in developing applications from scratch on paper to fully working and operational projects.\
I am not limited to application development only, but I am able to create the whole system.\
I develop solutions to the needs of the business sector by examining the requirements,
creating a network, choosing the appropriate tools/equipment, developing an application,
and after-service support. I provide training, maintenance and support.\
Project management skills were very useful at Makers Academy. I was able to assist Junior
Developers and lead them towards success. This resulted in a productive working
environment.

#### Knowledge Acquisition and Training

I joined Makers to further expand my knowledge and experience working with other people.
It was challenging, and I furthered my skills by pairing to solve coding challenges and
collaboratively create projects.\
The programming and tech sector is constantly expanding. This requires me to be on top of
the latest innovations and I enjoy expanding my knowledge.\
My current goal is to learn Q# language and make use of the rapid expansion of Quantum
Cloud, which has huge potential advantages.

#### Solution Design and Analysis

I am able to tailor the application to the business needs. This includes supervising the
manufacturing process of equipment needed to meet the required standards.\
I am skilled in job organisation by splitting the whole project into working groups, to tackling
any obstacles and move forwards towards the completion of the whole project.\
I am resilient.\
Projects at Makers Academy required forward-thinking and solutions. Multiple challenges
provided tests to my skills. I was able to challenge and improve myself.

#### Leadership Experience and Communication

The creation of a whole working system requires time and persistence. I am able to visualise
the project from inception to finish. This allows me to assist every step of the way and make
it better.\
To showcase this skill, please see the presentation video at [siit.uk/get-started/](https://siit.uk/get-started/) \
I created the whole script and make sure that all the best features of the application has
been included and presented at its best.\
My experience in leading the team proved to be useful at Makers Academy. My experience
with multiple programming techniques and languages enabled me to provide guidance
throughout project designing. Effective communication when teamworking was a key to
success, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Dev Bootcamp / 16-week program)
Further expansion of the knowledge and skills challenge. Paring sessions, teamwork, more coding and communication.

- Use Agile methodologies to work effectively in a team, using pair programming, XP values, daily standups and sprint planning.
- Give and receive feedback using code reviews and open/respectful communication.
- Understand project requirements, create user stories, define MVP's features, break features in smaller tasks to easily accomplish them.
- Collaborate with the other team members using GitHub as version control tools and using CI/CD to reduce integration risk.
- Code following principles like TDD and S.O.L.I.D of OOP design pattern to create clear, simple code and well tested applications.
- Development: OOP, OOD, TDD, MVC, DRY, KISS.
- Methodologies: Agile/XP, Waterfall, Asynchronous.
- Languages: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML5, Bootstrap.
- Testing: RSpec (rspec-rails), Jasmine, Jest, Capybara.
